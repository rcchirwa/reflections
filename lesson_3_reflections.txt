When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- being able to collaborate with others on the same code base 
- being able to use the remote for continuous integration 
- a safe guard against potentially  losing your work locally if your computer goes haywire.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- pull manually has the advantage because you do not want to lose any local changes that have not been staged or commit 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Fork is when you clone someone repository via github to github. It is an operation that happens within github
- Clone is when we make and exact duplicate of a repository either locally or from github akak a remote repository. Forks are a type of clone that only happen within Github. 
- Branches are [Explain later when have better understanding]


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- If you would like to acces it at a later point when you will not be online. 


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- Emailing files, meeting in person, using and arcaic version control system like Borland Star Team. 
- It would be harder especically syncing up real time components for code reviews. 



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

- You would make a change in a seperate branch if you would like to experiment.
- You could make a change in a separate branch if you are collaborating and would liek to put the code up somewhere for review by a peer or associate. 

- Advantage of not on master is that it will be intact in case the changes in the other brnach will be abandoned.  
Disadvantage if if the master change you will have to consitently merge tht back into the other branch being worked on to keep things consistent. 


Git Pull Notes:

- git branch -a will show the remote brnches as well 
- git pull = 
git fetch 
git merge master origin/master
